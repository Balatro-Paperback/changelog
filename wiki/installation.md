# Installation

- First, you need to install [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector). They have a detailed guide in the repository, which you should follow.

- Next, Paperback **requires** [SMODS](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods) to work. You'd download the latest release and put it in your Mods folder, which you should have after the Lovely installation. (Follow their [installation guide](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/wiki) if you're having issues)

- Once you have both Lovely and SMODS, you can choose which version of Paperback to use:

  - The [latest release](http://github.com/Balatro-Paperback/paperback/releases/latest), which is the stable version of the mod.
  - The [beta version](https://github.com/Balatro-Paperback/paperback/archive/refs/heads/beta.zip), that has the latest additions to the mod, but is a **work in progress**.

- After you've chosen, you'd put the downloaded folder into your Mods folder, and (assuming you've done all the steps correctly) you should be good to go.
