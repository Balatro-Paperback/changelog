# Balance Changes

### Boosters

- All Minor Arcana booster packs are now a bit rarer (d46755e374d0a67adc8c6d714d4d5d99e772457b by @srockw)

### Jokers

- (**Basic Joker Energy**) 6a940cb755514b1403c92afece159d8a276466f1 by @srockw

  - When The Fool is used to create a copy of a consumable that was previously Energized, the copy will also be Energized

- (**Resurrections**) cb3a855deee1ddcc4d8dc7af2d47f17d27ee4d57 by @srockw
  - Reworked. New effect: "Sold Jokers have a 1 in 5 chance to return and gain Negative edition with -$10 sell value. Chances increases by 1 on fail. Chance resets when activated"
  - This means having multiple copies of Resurrections will not create multiple Negative copies of a Joker, but rather have more opportunities for it to trigger.

### Decks

- (**Paper Deck**) 919123e3d396f5e1c27516a0e7ad77be0e6b2b03 by @srockw
  - Now starts run with a Shopping Center Joker

### Minor Arcana

- (**Eight of Wands**) 11eb06689ce7701c60147e2a9834eabd6d5a22a4 by @OppositeWolf770
  - Now considers the starting amount of Jokers instead of a fixed 5

### Paperclips

- Death no longer makes the left card keep its Paperclip (bf98cafd5a4ec5dcd14493dec5b85857a7eaf316 by @srockw)

### Jokers

- (**Wish You Were Here**) faae8b6c06c4ed441eb947c21d7597b8d69ef348 by @srockw

  - Now properly becomes free in shop when certain effects modify its price, for example, an edition tag

# QOL Changes

### Vouchers

- (**Celtic Cross**) 1f3db59720f3b1d4638fcac75871f3d57f99c2e8 by @srockw
  - Now directly spawns a free Mega Minor Arcana Pack in the shop, rather than give a Tag, which previously had unexpected behaviour with the Anaglyph deck

### Jokers

- (**Full Moon**) d3859832bea564d5eb7dedcb4f788aca3e1c2373 by @srockw
  - Now makes the used Planet card animate again instead of animating the Joker.
